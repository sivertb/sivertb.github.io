        <h2>Getting the accounts</h2>
        <p>
        The first step is getting the accounts that are trading the stock.
        Luckily the DELETE command leaks information in the error message. If
        you try to delete an order that isn't yours, it will happily tell you
        who it actually belongs to. Also worth nothing is that if you try to
        delete an order that doesn't exist, it will tell you the currently
        highest order ID. Might be handy in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting account orders</h2>
        <p>
        Once we have the accounts, we have to get their trades. The execution
        tape requires no authentication other than the account, which we now
        have. So, we:
        <ul>
            <li>Bootstrap by finding the accounts for the 50 first orders</li>
            <li>Start a websocket for each account, and gather the orders theh make</li>
            <li>If we get an execution, were one of the order IDs are unknown,
            we look up who made the order, and start a new websocket if this is
            a new account.</li>
            <li>Rinse and repeat, finally draw fancy graphs once we have enough orders</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>The proof</h2>

        <p>
        The CES96056409 account seem to only have sold on top, and bought on
        bottom. I did not actually run any statistical analysis, simply looked
        for something that looked suspecious. I also had some trouble with the
        websockets, getting an

        error message after a couple thousands orders. I therefore did not
        gather as much information as I'd would have liked to.
